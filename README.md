<p1><p1>Hello,this is my repository where I will keep all of my solution and project to the course of 1 of this Advance Machine Learning Speclization. These projects and assignments are quite challenging and diverse therefore the purpose of this repository is to help everyone who will be taking this speclization. I will make seprate repository for each course in this speclization. The main link to this speclization is: <a href='https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml#courses'> Advance Machine Learning Speclization by National Research University Higher School of Economics</a> and the link to the course-2 is <a href='https://www.coursera.org/learn/competitive-data-science'>How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers</a>

<p1>If you want to break into competitive data science, then this course is for you! Participating in predictive modelling competitions can help you gain practical experience, improve and harness your data modelling skills in various domains such as credit, insurance, marketing, natural language processing, salesâ€™ forecasting and computer vision to name a few. At the same time you get to do it in a competitive context against thousands of participants where each one tries to build the most predictive algorithm. Pushing each other to the limit can result in better performance and smaller prediction errors. Being able to achieve high ranks consistently can help you accelerate your career in data science.</a>
  
 <p2>In this course, you will learn to analyse and solve competitively such predictive modelling tasks. </p2>
